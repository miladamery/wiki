Variables are defined with `var` keyword. Important point to notice is that because variables defined with `var` can be reassigned `const` keyword will face errors.

There is a `final` keyword to create constants, but `const` is preferred.
`cost` is like `final` but `const` is compile time variable. As result you can't use `const` when variable value is determined in run time.

In `Dart` named arguments are optional by default, means they are nullable. If you want to change this add `required` keyword before argument.
